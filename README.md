[ios_system](https://github.com/holzschu/ios_system) is a replacement for `system()` that is compatible with AppStore rules and the iOS programming API. Commands are provided as dynamic libraries and loaded as they are required by the user. 

[ios_system](https://github.com/holzschu/ios_system) itself contains basic commands, operating on files (ls, mv, rm, tar, curl, grep...) More advanced commands are provided separately. `network_ios` is one of these extensions. To use it, just compile it and add it to the list of embedded libraries in your app (on top of all the libraries generated by [ios_system](https://github.com/holzschu/ios_system), of course). There is no change to make to ios_system: if the `libnetwork_ios.dylib` is present, it will execute the commands. Otherwise, it won't (but that's hardly surprising). 

Commands available in this package: 
- ping
- nc (netcat)
- nslookup
- host
- dig
- telnet
- whois

If you run them inside [OpenTerm](https://github.com/louisdh/terminal), the interactive versions work. I can't speak for other applications. 

## How to compile:

run `./compile_network_ios.sh`: this will create the binary framework `network_ios.xcframework`, which you can use in any Xcode project. 

## How to link:

Add this project as a Swift package dependency to your Xcode project, then embed the `network_ios.xcframework` framework.
